Why use jQuery:
- fixes "broken" DOM API
- brevity and clarity
- easy to use
- cross-browser support
- AJAX
- popularity -> large community to find answers

Why not use jQuery:
- DOM API is no longer broken
- may be too heavy a tool to use if you only use a few of the hundreds of methods
- performance inefficiency if methods used are not the most efficient
